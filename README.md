## BAC

This is a small model I created that monitors Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) levels over time.

The data for this project is from <em> Calculus & Mathematica </em> by Bill Davis, William Davis, Horacio Porta, and J. Jerry Uhl. It was published in 1994 by Addison Wesley Longman Inc. I accessed it through <em> A Course in Mathematical Modeling </em> by Douglas D. Mooney and Randall Swift, published by The Mathematical Association of America, 1999. 

There are a series of helper functions to create our output. First, the body fluid level is calculated based on a individual's gender and weight. Next, a recurrence function keeps track of BAC levels based on the amount of alcoholic drinks consumed at various time intervals. We finally plot these to keep track of an indivual's BAC over time.

This was a great discrete time model. All of my work is in Python. The code and html files are above ^_^
